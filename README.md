# optimization-techniques-project

This is a repository containing the code and reports for each of my 4 assignments for the "Optimization Techniques" class I took during 2024.

The course is part of the syllabus of the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

Each of the 4 excercises exists in each own branch and is implemented in Matlab. Each branch contains:
- Matlab function files that implement the algorithms
- Matlab files for creating the relevant graphs
- Two pdfs, one containing my report and another one for the assignment instructions in Greek
- A folder with the Latex files for my report inside
